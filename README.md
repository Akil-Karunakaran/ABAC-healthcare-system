The management of sensitive patient data in healthcare requires robust and fine-grained access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access or modify this information. Traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems often lack the flexibility needed to handle the dynamic and complex access requirements of modern healthcare environments. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) models offer a solution by defining access policies based on a combination of user, resource, and environmental attributes.

This project aims to design mathematical models for ABAC specifically tailored for healthcare applications, ensuring that access policies are both secure and adaptable to various contexts. To enhance the security of these access control mechanisms, the project will explore the use of cryptographic threshold schemes. These schemes distribute cryptographic operations among multiple parties, ensuring that no single party can unilaterally control access to sensitive data. By integrating ABAC with threshold cryptography and implementing these models within smart contracts, the project seeks to enforce fine-grained access policies in a decentralized and automated manner. This approach will not only improve the security and flexibility of access control in healthcare but also provide a practical framework for real-world implementation, making it an ideal subject for a college project.
